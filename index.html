    Attached is an image of a tsunami warning siren. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The siren is located on the west bank of the Swinomish Channel, a
    waterway that separates Fidalgo Island from the mainland of Washington.
    It is located in the community of Shelter Bay on the Swinomish
    Reservation, directly across the Swinomish Channel from the town of La
    Conner, Washington. The siren serves both the Shelter Bay and La Conner
    populations.
    </p>
    <p>
    The siren is located at the top of a post of approximately 30 feet. The
    base of the post is about 10 feet in elevation above sea level
    (Swinomish Channel).
    </p>
    <p>
    The image was taken facing West, from a parking lot that borders the
    west side of Moorage Way in Shelter Bay, Lat/Long (48.3900, -122.5006).
    </p>
    <p>
    A sign on the siren post informs the public of a schedule for siren
    testing.

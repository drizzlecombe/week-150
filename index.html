    <h1>CARES Winlink Net: Week 150 exercise</h1>

    <p>Your teammates' exercise material is below. I've provided their site /
        utility equipment description. Each AUXC should have at least one thumbnail.
        Click on the thumbnail to see the original image.</p>
    
    <p>Use the browser's back button to return to this page from the full-sized
        image.</p>

    <p> Your exercise requirements this week were to:</p>
    <div class="exercise-requirements">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Find a utility pole in your neighbourhood that has some additional
                equipment attached to it. For example: a fill-in 5G cell system, a fibre
                network distribution box or even just a transformer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take a clear picture of the equipment. Crop the image to just the
                utility equipment. <strong>Do not mark-up the image.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a <strong>plain Winlink message</strong> addressed to
                CLACKAMAS-WEEKLY NET and add your check-in sentence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Describe (briefly) where the image was taken from and roughly
                the direction you were facing. You may add your coordinates in
                your accompanying text, of course. Make sure you use an
                appropriate resolution (4 d.p.).
            </li>
            <li>
                Include any pertinent information. For example, the utility pole
                number (often on an affixed metal plate), anything that cannot be seen
                in your image.
            </li>
            <li>
                Attach your image to the plain Winlink message. Again, your goal is
                to get this image to 100 kbytes. Use the WLE image scaling tool to do
                this.
            </li>
        </ul>

            Attached is an image of a tsunami warning siren. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The siren is located on the west bank of the Swinomish Channel, a
            waterway that separates Fidalgo Island from the mainland of Washington.
            It is located in the community of Shelter Bay on the Swinomish
            Reservation, directly across the Swinomish Channel from the town of La
            Conner, Washington. The siren serves both the Shelter Bay and La Conner
            populations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The siren is located at the top of a post of approximately 30 feet. The
            base of the post is about 10 feet in elevation above sea level
            (Swinomish Channel).
        </p>
        <p>
            The image was taken facing West, from a parking lot that borders the
            west side of Moorage Way in Shelter Bay, Lat/Long (<a

        The pole includes three identifiers.  First, an anodized aluminum (or
